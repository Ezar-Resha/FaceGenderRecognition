# Face Gender Recognition AI Model Comparison

This project is created to compare the performance of different convuluted neural networks on recognizing gender based on facial features.
The model tested in this codebase is Googlnet-1 and Googlenet Inception 3. The results document contains the comparison result with Resnet18, Resnet50, and VGG16.

## How To Run

Ensure that the file path is correct, and all the codes should run properly.
You may want to comment some of the prints in the training function to conduct hyperparameter tuning (bayesian / grid / others) to prevent log spamming.
